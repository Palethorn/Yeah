<h2>First Steps</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Easiest way to install is to use composer. Create your project folder, add composer.json :</p>
<pre>
<code class="hljs json">
{
    "require": {
        "palethorn/yeah": "dev-master"
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

Then:
<pre>
<code class="hljs bash">
composer update
</code>
<pre>
<p>
You have a single folder called vendor inside your project folder. Inside of it is everything you need to get started.
You have installed Yeah! PHP Framework. We can refer to it as YeahFW.
</p>
<h3>Creating project structure</h3>
<p>
We'll start by building a sample application called blog. We need to create a project structure for it. YeahFW accepts
whatever structure you impose on it, as long as it's configured correctly. Sample structure we can use for our sample
project is this:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="hljs nohighlight">
.
├── blog
│   ├── config
|   ├── src
│   │   │── Controllers
|   │   │   └── HomeController.php
|   │   │── Models
│   │   │── Repositories
|   |   └── Blog.php
│   ├── data
│   └── views
│       ├── index.php
│       └── layouts
│           └── default.php
│── vendor
│── web
│    └── app_name.php
└── composer.json
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Examplanation of various files and directories:
<ul>
    <li>blog - Holds application specific configuration, controllers, models, and views. Controllers and models
can be namespaced</li>
    <li>config - Holds various app configuration. For example: paths.php can hold various project paths, db.php holds
database specific configuration etc.</li>
    <li>controllers - Put application controllers here. Controllers hold actions which are executed for specific
URL</li>
    <li>data - Various init files. For example: database skeletons, fixtures, export/import files and similar.</li>
    <li>models - Application ORM model files go here.</li>
    <li>views - Application views which are rendered in ther respective actions go here.</li>
    <li>Blog.php - Your main application class. Application is instantiated using this class. It holds all app
initialization specifics.</li>
    <li>vendor - Composer* packages go here. Everything you installed using composer is residing in this folder and is
managed through composer. Best not to touch it. Most of it is autogenerated and can be overwritten when composer
update is run.</li>
    <li>web - All publicly accessible files go here. PHP index files, javascript files, stylesheets, static html files
go here.</li>
    <li>composer.json - Exposes project dependencies which are managed via composer*.</li>
</ul>
