<h2>Routing</h2>

<p>More often you want different actions for different urls. YeahFW supports several ways to achieve that. Routes defined
in this tutorial look pretty simple, but in actuality they represent regex, which is then matched with HTTP
request path. You can use string literals, but beware of the regex
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html">special characters</a>.
If you want to match them, they need to be escaped with a backslash (\).</p>

<h3>Simple Routes</h3>

<p>Simple routes use closure to execute an action. Examples of simple routes:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs php">
    // web/index.php

    // Standard init goes here...

    /**
     *  Syntax: $app->route$Method$('path', function() {
     *     // Execute your code here ...
     * });
     */

    $app->routeGet('/get', function() {
       echo "GET method used";
    });
    $app->routePost('/post', function() {
       echo "POST method used";
    });
    $app->routePut('/put', function() {
       echo "PUT method used";
    });
    $app->routeDelete('/delete', function() {
       echo "DELETE method used";
    });

    $app->execute();
</code></pre>

<p>You can attach these routes directly to an application instance. These routes match url with one of the standard HTTP
methods. If a match is found then the corresponding closure is executed. You can consider these routes as simplified
 REST routes, because they are. App:routeGet(), App:routePost(), App:routePut(), App:routeDelete() methods are just a
 simplified wrapper for configuring routes as demonstrated in the following section.</p>

<h2>Standard Routing</h2>
<p>YeahFW also comes with what you can recognize as a standard routing flavour. These can get quite complex, as they
support multitude of options. They require overriding App::loadRoutes() method. Sample of a route configuration for
posts path</p>
<pre>
<code class="hljs php">
    // blog/src/Blog.php
    class Blog extends \Yeah\Fw\Application\App {
        public function loadRoutes() {
            // Standard route with Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\RouteRequestHandler
            \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add('/posts', array(
                'route_request_handler' => 'Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\RouteRequestHandler',
                'controller' => 'Controllers\PostsController',
                'action' => 'index',
                'secure' => false,
                'prefix' => '/api'
            ));

            // Restful route with Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\SimpleRouteRequestHandler
            \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add($url, array(
                'route_request_handler' => 'Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\SimpleRouteRequestHandler',
                'secure' => $secure,
                'restful' => array('GET' => (
                    array(
                        'method' => 'get',
                        'cache' => array('is_cacheable' => false, 'cache_duration' => 1440),
                        'secure' => false
                    )
                )
            )));

            // Restful route with \Yeah\Fw\Routing\RestRouteRequestHandler
            \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add('/posts/(.*)', array(
                'controller' => 'post',
                'route_request_handler' => '\Yeah\Fw\Routing\RestRouteRequestHandler',
                'secure' => false,
                'restful' => array(
                    'GET' => array(
                        'secure' => false,
                        'action' => 'get'
                    )
                )
            ));
        }
    }
</code>

<p>
What's up with these different route types? And what are those handlers? Well, they basically do the same stuff, it's
just the way the action is executed that is different.</p><p> Standard route with Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\RouteRequestHandler
will match the path, instantiate a controller object using "controller" parameter which indicates a class, then executes
specified method using "action" parameter. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Restful routes with Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\SimpleRouteRequestHandler are actually those simple routes which are
added behind App::route$Method$ methods. Difference with these is that they know how to handle closures as actions.</p>
<p>Finally there are restful routes with \Yeah\Fw\Routing\RestRouteRequestHandler, and they are pure rest routes. They
execute a class action only then when both path and method are matched. If a path is matched, for a HTTP method in
question, configured controller method is executed.</p><p> Additional configuration parameters explanation:

<ul>
<li>secure - Indicates whether path requires authentication and authorization. If it does, application security layer is
    executed before executing the action.</li>
<li>
    cache - Indicates whether to cache the action response. Accepts an array with indicates whether to activate cache, and
    cache duration.
</li>
<li>
    prefix - Great for grouping and versioning actions, for example, versioning an API as /api_v1 or /api_v2. Routes will
    only be matched if they have that prefix. For example if a route has prefix "/api", route will match /api/posts,
    but not /posts.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Separating Routing Configuration</h2>
<p>
As the time passes, more and more functionality and configuration is added to your application class. To remove clutter,
provide better mainainability, and readability, you can load routes from external file. Just move your routes to
blog/config/routes.php
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="hljs php">
        // blog/config/routes.php
        \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add('/posts', array(
            'route_request_handler' => 'Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\RouteRequestHandler',
            'controller' => 'Controllers\PostsController',
            'action' => 'index',
            'secure' => false,
            'prefix' => '/api'
        ));

        \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add($url, array(
            'route_request_handler' => 'Yeah\Fw\Routing\RouteRequest\SimpleRouteRequestHandler',
            'secure' => $secure,
            'restful' => array('GET' => (
                array(
                    'method' => 'get',
                    'cache' => array('is_cacheable' => false, 'cache_duration' => 1440),
                    'secure' => false
                )
            )
        )));

        \Yeah\Fw\Routing\Router::add('/posts/(.*)', array(
            'controller' => 'post',
            'route_request_handler' => '\Yeah\Fw\Routing\RestRouteRequestHandler',
            'secure' => false,
            'restful' => array(
                'GET' => array(
                    'secure' => false,
                    'action' => 'get'
                )
            )
        ));
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Then just include the file in App::loadRoutes() method:</p>
<pre>
    <code class="hljs php">
    // blog/src/Blog.php
    class Blog extends \Yeah\Fw\Application\App {
        public function loadRoutes() {
            require $this->config->config_dir . '/routes.php';
        }
    }
</code>
</pre>
<p>provided that you pass "config_dir" array parameter when initializing application:</p>
<pre>
<code class="hljs php">
    // web/index.php

    // Include composer autoloader
    require_once '../vendor/autoload.php';

    $config = array(
        'dev' => array(
            'config_dir' => dirname('__FILE__') . '/../blog/config'
        )
    );

    $app = new Blog('blog', 'dev', $config);

    $app->execute();
</code>
</pre>
